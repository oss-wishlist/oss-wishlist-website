## Overview

A comprehensive security audit evaluates your project's overall security posture, including dependency management, repository configurations, and alignment with OpenSSF best practices. Our practitioners use industry-standard tools and manual review to identify vulnerabilities and provide actionable recommendations.

## What's Included

### Repository Security
- Branch protection rules assessment and setup
- Code review requirements evaluation
- Access control and permissions audit
- Secret scanning configuration
- Security policy and SECURITY.md review

### Dependency Management
- Automated vulnerability scanning across all dependencies
- Dependabot configuration and optimization
- Analysis of transitive dependencies
- License compliance check
- Unmaintained package identification
- Supply chain attack surface evaluation

### OpenSSF Scorecard Alignment
- Complete Scorecard evaluation
- Gap analysis against security best practices
- Recommendations to improve score
- Implementation guidance for missing checks
- Continuous monitoring setup

### Security Automation
- GitHub Actions security workflows
- Automated security testing setup
- CI/CD pipeline security review
- Security notification configuration

### Remediation Plan
- Prioritized security fixes by severity
- Repository configuration improvements
- Dependency upgrade path recommendations
- Breaking change impact assessment
- Timeline for addressing critical issues

## Common Use Cases

- **OpenSSF Best Practices**: Improve your OpenSSF Scorecard score and security posture
- **Pre-acquisition due diligence**: Comprehensive security assessment before M&A
- **Regulatory compliance**: Meet requirements for SOC 2, ISO 27001, or industry standards
- **Incident response**: Complete security review after a breach or supply chain compromise
- **New project setup**: Establish security best practices from the start
- **Periodic review**: Annual or quarterly security audits to maintain readiness

## Why This Matters

- **OpenSSF Scorecard** is becoming the industry standard for measuring open source security
- **85% of codebases** contain known security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **Supply chain attacks** have increased 650% in recent years
- **Branch protection** and code review prevent 70% of security issues
- **Regulatory requirements** increasingly mandate comprehensive security audits

## What You'll Receive

1. **Executive Summary**: High-level findings, risk assessment, and OpenSSF score
2. **OpenSSF Scorecard Report**: Detailed analysis of all Scorecard checks with improvement recommendations
3. **Repository Security Assessment**: Evaluation of branch protection, access controls, and security settings
4. **Dependency Analysis**: Complete vulnerability scan with remediation priorities
5. **Remediation Roadmap**: Step-by-step implementation plan with effort estimates
6. **Configuration Templates**: Ready-to-use branch protection rules, workflow files, and security policies
7. **Follow-up Consultation**: 30-60 minute session to review findings and answer questions

## Ideal For

- Projects seeking to improve their OpenSSF Scorecard score
- Organizations with compliance and audit requirements
- Teams preparing for security certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001)
- Companies conducting M&A due diligence
- Critical infrastructure projects requiring high security standards
- Projects that haven't had a security review in 6+ months
- New projects establishing security best practices

## Delivery Timeline

- **Small Projects**: 1-2 weeks
- **Medium Projects**: 2-4 weeks  
- **Large Projects**: 4-6 weeks

Delivery includes OpenSSF Scorecard evaluation, repository configuration review, dependency analysis, and comprehensive remediation planning.
