## Overview

The EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) introduces mandatory cybersecurity requirements for products with digital elements sold in the EU market, effective from 2027. This service helps open source maintainers understand their CRA obligations, assess current compliance status, and implement necessary security practices to support commercial adoption of their software.

## What's Included

### CRA Compliance Assessment
- Determination of whether your project falls under CRA scope
- Product classification (important vs. critical digital components)
- Commercial use case analysis and downstream obligations
- Gap analysis against CRA essential cybersecurity requirements
- Open source steward vs. manufacturer liability assessment

### Vulnerability Management Framework
- Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) process implementation
- Security incident response procedures
- SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation and automation
- Vulnerability tracking and remediation workflows
- Security advisory publication process (GitHub Security Advisories)

### Secure Development Practices
- Secure-by-design and secure-by-default architecture review
- Security risk assessment methodology
- Code review and testing requirements implementation
- Security documentation (SECURITY.md, vulnerability disclosure policy)
- Security update delivery mechanisms

### Technical Documentation
- EU Declaration of Conformity preparation guidance
- CE marking requirements for digital components
- Technical documentation package assembly
- Conformity assessment procedures
- Record-keeping and compliance evidence management

### Supply Chain Security
- Dependency SBOM generation and validation
- Third-party component security assessment
- Transitive dependency vulnerability tracking
- Update and patching strategy for dependencies
- Open source license compliance verification

### Ongoing Compliance Support
- Security monitoring and update obligations
- Incident reporting requirements (ENISA notification)
- Post-market surveillance recommendations
- Market surveillance authority cooperation guidance
- End-of-support lifecycle communication

## Common Use Cases

- **Commercial product integration**: Support downstream companies integrating your OSS into EU-market products
- **Steward liability reduction**: Minimize open source maintainer exposure under CRA manufacturer definitions
- **Pre-compliance preparation**: Get ready before CRA enforcement (2027 deadlines)
- **Foundation compliance**: Help OSS foundations support their hosted projects
- **Corporate OSS programs**: Enable companies to maintain CRA-compliant open source projects
- **Critical infrastructure**: Meet enhanced requirements for critical products (Class I/II)
- **Procurement requirements**: Satisfy EU public sector cybersecurity procurement mandates

## Why This Matters

- **CRA applies from 2027**: All products with digital elements sold in the EU must comply
- **Open source is in scope**: Commercial distribution of OSS may trigger manufacturer obligations
- **Downstream liability**: Your users need compliant components to sell their products in EU
- **Foundation exposure**: OSS foundations may be classified as manufacturers under certain conditions
- **€15M or 2.5% revenue fines**: Non-compliance penalties are severe for economic operators
- **Market access**: CRA compliance is a prerequisite for EU market entry
- **Competitive advantage**: CRA-ready projects enable faster commercial adoption

## What You'll Receive

1. **CRA Applicability Report**: Determination of whether and how CRA applies to your project
2. **Compliance Gap Analysis**: Assessment against CRA essential cybersecurity requirements (Annex I)
3. **SBOM Implementation**: Automated SBOM generation setup (SPDX or CycloneDX format)
4. **Vulnerability Management Plan**: CVD process, security advisory workflows, and incident response
5. **Technical Documentation Package**: Templates and guidance for conformity documentation
6. **Remediation Roadmap**: Prioritized implementation plan with CRA deadline milestones
7. **Open Source Best Practices**: Alignment with OpenSSF Scorecard and secure development standards
8. **Follow-up Consultation**: 60-90 minute session covering implementation questions and CRA updates

## Ideal For

- Open source projects with significant commercial downstream adoption
- OSS foundations supporting portfolio projects with CRA obligations
- Corporate-sponsored open source projects sold or integrated into products
- Critical infrastructure software components (Linux kernels, databases, web servers)
- Security and cryptography libraries used in commercial products
- Developer tools and frameworks distributed with EU-market products
- Projects seeking to differentiate through proactive CRA compliance
- Maintainers concerned about manufacturer liability exposure

## Delivery Timeline

- **Small Projects**: 2-3 weeks
- **Medium Projects**: 4-6 weeks  
- **Large Projects**: 6-10 weeks

Delivery includes CRA scope analysis, compliance gap assessment, SBOM and vulnerability management setup, technical documentation guidance, and comprehensive implementation roadmap.
