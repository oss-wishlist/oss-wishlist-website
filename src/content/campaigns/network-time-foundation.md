Network Time Protocol (NTP) is one of the internet's oldest and most critical protocols, dating back to 1985. According to cybersecurity research, [NTP "remains a cornerstone of modern computing synchronization, and it is crucial for maintaining the proper operation and security of computing devices"](https://www.beyondtrust.com/blog/entry/the-implications-of-network-time-protocol-ntp-for-cybersecurity).

The Network Time Foundation maintains and develops this essential protocol that enables clock synchronization across networked computing devices.

## How to Support

The Network Time Foundation has a goal of raising **$11,000** to support ongoing development, security audits, and infrastructure maintenance.
