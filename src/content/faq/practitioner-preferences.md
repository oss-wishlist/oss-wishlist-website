## Practitioner Preferences and Nominations

There are three ways preferences and nominations can be expressed on the platform today:

### 1) Preferred Practitioner (Maintainer)

You can select **1 preferred practitioner** from our verified directory. This indicates your preference for working with this specific practitioner.

**Important notes:**
- Preferences are considered but **not guaranteed**
- Final matching depends on practitioner availability, capacity, and expertise alignment
- We aim to honor preferences whenever possible while ensuring quality matches

### 2) Your Nominee (Employee) (Sponsor)

When fulfilling a wishlist, sponsors can propose an internal employee (or contractor under your organization) to do the work.

What we check:
- Expertise fit with the requested service(s)
- Any conflicts of interest
- Availability and ability to meet scope and timelines

If the nominee is a strong fit, they can be approved to fulfill the wish.

### 3) Maintainer Nominee (Community Member)

If a maintainer knows someone from their community who they'd like to work with (and who isn't in our directory), they can nominate them by providing:
- Their name
- Email address
- GitHub username

**Nominee vetting process:**
- All nominees must meet OSS Wishlist's practitioner criteria
- We evaluate against our [practitioner rubric](/practitioners#criteria)
- Nominees who qualify will be invited to create a practitioner profile
- Once verified, they can be matched with wishlists

**What happens next:**
1. We review the nominee's background and expertise
2. If qualified, we reach out to invite them to apply
3. After they complete the application and are approved, they can fulfill wishes
4. We'll notify you of their status

### No Guaranteed Assignment

Neither preferences nor nominations guarantee assignment. Our goal is to make the best match for your project's needs while respecting your input and ensuring practitioner quality standards.
