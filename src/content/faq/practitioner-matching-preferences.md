## Practitioner Matching with Multiple Preferences

When fulfilling a wishlist, we often receive practitioner preferences from both the **maintainer** (who created the wishlist) and the **sponsor** (who is funding the work). Our goal is to consider both perspectives and work collaboratively to find the best solution.

### How It Works

Each fulfillment is unique, and we take a flexible, collaborative approach:

1. **Maintainer Preferences**: When creating a wishlist, maintainers can:
   - Select 1 preferred practitioner from our directory
   - Nominate someone from their community (subject to vetting)

2. **Sponsor Preferences**: When fulfilling a wishlist, sponsors can:
   - Choose specific practitioners from available options
   - Use their own employee as the practitioner
   - Request we select the best match

3. **Collaborative Matching**: We review:
   - Maintainer's preferences and any nominees
   - Sponsor's selection or preferences
   - Practitioner availability and expertise fit
   - Project requirements and timeline

### Common Scenarios

**Both parties prefer the same practitioner**
- Perfect alignment! We proceed with that practitioner.

**Different preferences**
- We facilitate a discussion between maintainer, sponsor, and practitioners
- We may propose alternative solutions (e.g., co-delivery, split responsibilities)
- Final decision considers expertise alignment and all parties' input

**Sponsor using employee practitioner + Maintainer has nominee**
- We explore collaboration opportunities (mentorship, co-delivery)
- Nominee can participate if approved and sponsor agrees
- We ensure the arrangement serves the project's best interests

**No preferences from one party**
- We prioritize the stated preference from the other party
- We validate the match meets quality and expertise standards

### Our Commitment

- **Transparency**: All parties know about expressed preferences
- **Flexibility**: Every situation is unique; we adapt our approach
- **Quality first**: Expertise and project fit are always paramount
- **Collaboration**: We work with everyone to reach the right solution
- **No guarantees**: Neither maintainer nor sponsor preferences are binding, but both are seriously considered

### Vetting and Approval

All practitioners (preferred, nominated, or employee-based) must:
- Meet OSS Wishlist quality standards
- Have appropriate expertise for the service
- Be available for the project timeline
- Align with our practitioner criteria
