For our first pilot we will only select up to 10 practitioners. We are SUPER mindful that there are many qualified people. The approval process is not intended to gatekeep but rather to keep things small at first, to get to know people, and expand from there. We will have our own leadership and governance strategies to ensure that this project represents the best in sustainability as well.


Our practitioner selection process looks like this:

1. **Application Review**: We evaluate experience, expertise areas, and past work in open source
2. **Matching Assessment**: We learn more about you, what you want to focus on, preferences, limitations, timezone (etc.), potential conflicts of interest — and finally your goals around being matched with a wish.
5. **Ongoing Evaluation**: We will provide maintainers, sponsors, and practitioners with ways to evaluate their experiences.

Once approved, practitioners will be asked to attend an onboarding, and will have a profile added to our practitioners page.
