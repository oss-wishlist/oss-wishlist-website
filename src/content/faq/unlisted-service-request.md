We are focused on building the capabilities for the services and resources currently listed in our catalog. However, we understand that every project has unique needs.

If you need something that isn't currently listed, you can email us at **info@oss-wishlist.com** to request another service or resource.

**Important notes:**
- We cannot promise we'll be able to add your requested service
- We will look into all requests and consider them for future expansion
- Building new service capabilities takes time and requires finding qualified practitioners

We appreciate your feedback - it helps us understand what the open source community needs most!
