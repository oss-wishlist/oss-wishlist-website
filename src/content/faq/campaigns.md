We sometimes feature parallel efforts across the ecosystem as Campaigns. These are time‑bound initiatives that align with our mission to improve the sustainability and health of open source projects.

Campaigns are not marketing or product promotions for companies—they should clearly be about advancing sustainability outcomes for open source (for example: governance improvements, security posture upgrades, contributor onboarding, funding pathways, documentation sprints, or community health).

There’s no heavy process or formal criteria beyond that: if it’s genuinely about sustainability for an open source project or ecosystem (not brand promotion), we’re happy to link out and help amplify it.
