The platform works in three simple steps:

1. **Maintainers** create wishlists describing their project needs (governance, security, funding, community building, etc.)
2. **Wishlist Sponsors** (companies, foundations, sponsors) browse public wishlists and commit to fulfilling specific needs
3. **Open Source Practitioners** provide the expertise and services to complete the work

`Open Source Wishlist` maintainers onboard and offboard the wish, and evaluate success according to rubrics in each service playbook.
