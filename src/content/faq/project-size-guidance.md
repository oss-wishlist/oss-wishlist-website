When picking a size for your wishlist, choose the option that best reflects the scope and complexity of your project today. This helps us show the most accurate price estimate for each service.

- Small:
  - Few active contributors, low to moderate activity
  - Single repository or a simple structure
  - Straightforward architecture and governance
- Medium:
  - Growing contributor base and more regular activity
  - Multiple repositories or a moderately complex codebase
  - Multi-stakeholder needs emerging (users, maintainers, partners)
- Large:
  - Complex ecosystem or broad adoption
  - Many repositories or a large/complex codebase
  - High downstream dependencies or community impact

Notes:
- These sizes are a starting point - not a gate. Practitioners will confirm fit during scoping.
- If you’re unsure, choose Medium. We’ll help calibrate together.
- See the Catalogue Pricing page for example deliverables and outcomes by tier.
