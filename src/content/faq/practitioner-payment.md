Practitioners are compensated directly by the Wishlist Sponsors via one of two platforms (Open Collective of GitHub Sponsors):

- **Direct Payment**: Sponsors pay practitioners directly, not through `Open Source Wishlist`
- **Fair Rates**: We provide guidance on market rates to ensure fair compensation based on USD, sponsors may pay more, but not less
- **Milestone-Based**: Wish match obligations are considered met on successful rubric scoring.  

Please see [Terms and COnditions](oss-wishlist-website/terms) for more on obligations.
