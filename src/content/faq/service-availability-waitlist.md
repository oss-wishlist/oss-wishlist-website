Yes. If a service is shown as “Not currently available,” you can still select it when creating or editing your wishlist. We’ll add your request to our waitlist and notify you as soon as a qualified practitioner becomes available.

Why does this happen?

- Practitioner capacity varies over time
- Some services require specific expertise and may be temporarily full
- New practitioners are continually being onboarded

What should I do?

- Select all services you need, even if some are "Not currently available"
- We’ll track your interest and prioritize onboarding for high-demand services
- You’ll receive an email update when the service becomes available

Tip: If timing is flexible, include that in your notes so we can better match your needs.
