Great question! While we absolutely encourage and value all types of open source contributions, practitioners serve a specialized and distinct role:

**Traditional Open Source Contributors** typically engage through a project's standard contribution pathway — fixing bugs, adding features, writing documentation, or participating in community discussions. These contributions are often ongoing and integrated into the project's regular development workflow.

**Open Source Practitioners**, on the other hand, are matched specifically for their expertise in areas that aren't always part of a typical project contribution pathway. These specialized services include:

- Setting up governance frameworks
- Conducting security audits
- Developing community health strategies
- Creating documentation systems
- Implementing DevRel programs
- Building moderation policies

The key differences:

1. **Specialized Expertise**: Practitioners are vetted for specific professional skills and experience in these non-code areas
2. **Time-Bound Matching**: Engagements are focused, scoped projects with clear deliverables rather than ongoing contributions
3. **Structured Process**: Wishes are fulfilled through a formal matching and engagement process, often with funding support
4. **Professional Services**: These are specialized services that maintainers might otherwise hire consultants to provide

We celebrate all forms of open source contribution! Open Source Wishlist simply focuses on connecting maintainers with practitioners for these specialized, time-bound needs that fall outside traditional contribution pathways.
