Open Source Wishlist is the bridge between knowing what makes projects sustainable and actually getting there. Based on exsiting industry standards, we provide the missing vocabulary for maintainers to request specific help, the validated pathways to deliver it, and the metrics to prove it worked.

## The Process

A simple three-step process that connects needs with resources

### 1. Maintainers Create Wishlists

Open source maintainers browse our catalogue of services and resources, then create a wishlist identifying critical needs for their project's sustainability.

- Choose from curated services and resources
- Services include security audits, governance setup, funding strategy, and more
- Resources include infrastructure hosting, moderation tools, etc.
- Wishlists are currently public (transitioning to private for security)

### 2. Wishlist Sponsors Fund Wishes

Companies, foundations, and individuals who depend on open source step in to fund one or more wishes from a project's wishlist.

- Browse active wishlists from projects you depend on
- Fund specific services or resources
- Funds managed through GitHub Sponsors or Open Collective
- Direct, measurable impact on project sustainability

### 3. Practitioners Deliver Services

Vetted open source practitioners with validated expertise are matched with funded wishes to deliver professional services.

- Practitioners meet quality standards set by OSS Wishlist
- Hired through our platform or provided by Wishlist Sponsors
- Work directly with maintainers on critical needs
- Fair compensation for expertise and labor

### 4. Peer Review Ensures Quality

After practitioners complete their work, peer review ensures the quality and completeness of deliverables.

- Playbooks include rubrics to assess outcomes
- Other practitioners and community experts review completed work
- Peer review validates that deliverables meet quality standards
- Ensures accountability and continuous improvement
