# About Us

`Open Source Wishlist`  *is* an open source, open content, community project created by Emma Irwin, in partnership open source collaborator Christos Bacharakis and with feedback from many of our peers, maintainers and potential funders . 

# About Open Source Wishlist

Open source projects cannot be sustainable without help. Direct funding helps in some ways (and we should keep doing that!), but it also leaves additional work for the maintainers to use that money in ways that make their project actually sustainable.

Sponsors often fund projects, but have a hard time describing how those funds had impact on sustainability.

# Look for the Helpers

> "When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, 'Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.'" — Fred Rogers

At OSS Wishlist, we're bringing together a community of helpers: practitioners, sponsors, and other contributors who are ready to make a real difference for open source sustainability using tools, resources,  metrics and standards that already exist.
