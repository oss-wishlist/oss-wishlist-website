# About Us

`Open Source Wishlist`  *is* an open source, open content, community project created by [Emma Irwin](https://github.com/emmairwin) with help from long-time open source collaborator [Christos Bacharakis](https://github.com/bacharakis) and with feedback from many of our peers, maintainers and potential funders . 

## About Open Source Wishlist

`Open Source Wishlist` seeks to break down the silos of isolation between maintainers and funders by standardizing the way in which projects can express and receive meaningful support.  

**From isolation to connection**: Instead of pleading into the void, maintainers can articulate need aligned with known sustainability risk and connect with skilled open source pracitioners ready to help.

**From burden to support**: Instead of shouldering sustainability work alone, maintainers can access paid open source practitioners with proven experience and expertise.

**From guesswork to insight**: Instead of relying on quantitative metrics alone, companies and funders can gain firsthand, qualitative understanding of sustainability risks and take immediate action to address them.

**From hope to evidence**: Instead of hoping for help and impact, both maintainers and funders can track real outcomes and demonstrate tangible results.  The ecosystem gets healthier!



## Look for the Helpers

> "When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, 'Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.'" — Fred Rogers

At `Open Source Wishlist`, we're bringing together a community of helpers: practitioners, sponsors, and other contributors who are ready to make a real difference for open source sustainability using tools, resources,  metrics and standards that already exist.
